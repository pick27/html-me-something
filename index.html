                <h2>General Info</h2>
                <img
                    class='image--inline'
                    src="images/usual.jpg"

                <p>I really truly hate being told to be creative. I prefer to
                    have a reasonable blueprint of what is wanted. I want to be
                    a web developer not a website designer.
                </p>
                <p>I prefer to keep quite a bit of my life private. The picture
                    on this about page is about 5 years old when I was about 50
                    pounds heavier.
                </p>
                <p>I read lots of books. Luckily for me most of
                    the books I have are either in Kindle or Nook format rather
                    than actual physical books. The eight plus bookshelves of
                    books is just the tip of the iceberg.

            <h2>Employers and Jobs</h2>
            <p><span class='text--start-with'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> - November 2015 to
                present</span>. I am a fulfullment center associate. Where I
                work that means you move boxes from point A to point B in the
                warehouse. Recently most of my shifts at work have been as a
                splitter (either splitting packages as low side/high side/wrong
                line or as line X/line Y/wrong line). Almost all of the
                remaining shifts I am a scanner (scan package, move it to a
                pallet, scan other package on pallet to show it is on the right
                pallet). I prefer splitting since I don't have to constantly see
                how bad some pallets have been built.
            </p>
            <p><span class='text--start-with'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.usa800.com/">USA800</a> - April 1987 to May
                2014</span>. This is a call center (mostly inbound). The first
                year I was one of the telephone operators. For the remaining
                time I was in the DP/IS/IT department. While learning about
                their database I was the one assigned to batch process credit
                cards, run late morning reports, and print/fax those reports.
                After learning the database and how they put scripts (what the
                operators see) together, I got to actually be a programmer.

            <p><span class='text--start-with'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> -
                January 1987</span>. I was supposed to be a data transcriber on
                the night shift. My car and I found out we didn't like the hours
                so I quit quickly while still in training.</p>
            <p><span class='text--start-with'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nwmissouri.edu/">Northwest Missouri State
                University</a> - Fall 1984 to Fall 1985</span>. I was a Lab
                Consultant in the library's computer lab. I helped students
                with the equipment (printer/terminal/teletype) and sometimes
                with their programming assignments. I tried to ask them
                questions to get them going toward the solution rather than
                just telling them what to type.</p>

            <h2>Schools Attended</h2>
            <p><span class='text--start-with'>New Horizons Computer Learning
                Center</span>. I attended this school in late 2014 to take
                classes to prepare me to take the Comptia A+, Network+, and
                Security+ exams in order to get a job in network administration
                or network security. I also attended this school in the summer
                of 2003 to learn about VB .Net. USA800 was switching from the
                scripting method I had learned to web a version.
            </p>
            <p><span class='text--start-with'>Northwest Missouri State
                University</span>. I received a BS in Computer Science in 1986.
            </p>
            <p><span class='text--start-with'>Longview Community College</span>.
                I took a Cobol class the summer of 1981 so that I could enter
                a 2-year program at the beginning of the second year.
